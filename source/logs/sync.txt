Overview
--------

{+service+} creates sync logs whenever a user interacts with Sync. This
includes writing data to {+backend+} from clients, reading changes from
{+backend+} to clients, as well as any time a connection or session starts
or ends.

Fields
~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Remote IP Address
     - The IP Address that sent the request to {+backend+}. (e.g. ``52.21.89.200``)

   * - Compute Used
     - Computational load of the operation.

   * - Platform Version
     - The version of the platform that sent the request.

   * - SDK
     - The SDK used to send the request. Potential values include any :doc:`{+service-short+} Client SDK </procedures/init-realmclient>`. For a browser, this is ``<browser> <SDK version>``.

       .. example::

          This request came from the {+service-short+} JS Browser SDK version 4.0.0
          running on Mozilla Firefox

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: firefox v4.0.0

          This request came from the {+service-short+} Android SDK version 4.6.0 running
          on Android Marshmallow:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: android v4.6.0

   * - Function Call Location
     - The data center in which the function was executed.

   * - Rule Performance Metrics
     - A summary of the :doc:`roles </mongodb/query-roles>`, :doc:`schema </mongodb/document-schemas>`, and :doc:`filters </mongodb/query-filters>` applied to a return value. Provides the number of documents that a role applies to as well as the number of fields in those documents that Realm evaluated and potentially withheld.
